## Nice to meet you, I'm Melanie! 
I am interested in both teaching and using spatial data science for the purposes of sustainable natural resource management.
You can see what I am mostly up to on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/melaniesleung). I also occasionally tweet [@melaniesleung](https://twitter.com/melaniesleung).

I recently worked on a team with NASA DEVELOP, the [Florida Transportation & Infrastructure Project](https://www.devpedia.developexchange.com/dp/index.php?title=Florida_Transportation_%26_Infrastructure_ARC_Summer_2021),
where I developed remote sensing skills to help generate a graphical user interface that helps monitor water quality conditions of southeastern Florida seaports.


## Some more about me:

:herb: Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and geospatial Python

:mortar_board: I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Environmental Studies

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that use remote sensing and geographic information systems to advance our understanding of coastal resources with consideration of the impacts of climate change.

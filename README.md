## Nice to meet you, I'm Mel! 
I am interested in both teaching and using spatial data science for the purposes of natural resource management.
You can see what I am mostly up to on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/melaniesleung). I also occasionally tweet [@melaniesleung](https://twitter.com/melaniesleung).

Over the last year, I've been working on coastal remote sensing projects with Professor Cavanaugh's lab at UC Los Angeles, and NASA's DEVELOP program: 
> [Florida Transportation & Infrastructure Project](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2021/summer/FloridaTI.html)
> Southern California Health & Air Quality Project
Using satellite imagery, my DEVELOP team and I worked to create graphical user interfaces to help monitor water quality conditions such as turbidity and harmful algal blooms.

Currently, I'm working on kelp mapping and classification projects, using both satellite and UAV data. 

## Some more about me:

:herb: I am an instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). I mostly lead and/or co-teach workshops on the fundamentals of Python and R.

:mortar_board: I graduated in spring of 2021 from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Environmental Studies

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in using remote sensing and geographic information systems to advance our understanding of coastal resources with the consideration of climate change and its impacts on coastal communities.

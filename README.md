## Nice to meet you, I'm Mel! 
I am interested in using spatial data science methods for the purposes of supporting data-driven decision making. 

Over the last few years, I worked on coastal remote sensing projects with Professor Cavanaugh's lab at UC Los Angeles, and NASA's DEVELOP program: 

- [Florida Transportation & Infrastructure Project](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/projects/monitoring_water_quality_along_southern_florida_seaports_to_assess_impact_on_coral_reef_tracts_from_harbor_deepening_projects)
- [Southern California Health & Air Quality Project](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/projects/using-remote-sensing-detect-frequency-and-drivers-red-tide-blooms-california)
    
Currently, I'm working on further advancing my geospatial analysis and cartography skills to create interactive maps and charts. It's a work in progress but I recently
started building a [R Shiny App](https://melanieleung.shinyapps.io/thailandtrip/) to visualize and document my solo travel journey through Thailand. In my free time I've been playing around with Mapbox to create diverse mapping applications: 
- [Heatmap of Meteorite Strike Data](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/melaniesleung/clfv0189l006m01rpd399qeib.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWVsYW5pZXNsZXVuZyIsImEiOiJjbGZ0YXR2aWMwNTVqM3FxaWxxbDNjd252In0.FaWof3PkPJljwiltrXOYoQ&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#3.2/40.14/-96.29)
- [3D Visualization of 2008 US Presidential Election Voter Turnout](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/melaniesleung/clfxi8reb000u01mikc5hgxwm.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWVsYW5pZXNsZXVuZyIsImEiOiJjbGZ0YXR2aWMwNTVqM3FxaWxxbDNjd252In0.FaWof3PkPJljwiltrXOYoQ&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#3.54/36.09/-100.2/330.9/51)

## Some more about me:

:herb: I am an instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). I mostly lead and/or co-teach workshops on the fundamentals of Python and R.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about how to apply creative graphic design skills that I've learned in the past (see [portfolio](https://melanieleung.wixsite.com/portfolio/projects)) towards developing visually appealing and informative maps.
